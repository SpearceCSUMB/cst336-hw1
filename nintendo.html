        and with this entertainment available to the world their popularity took off.</P>
    
      <P>Today, Nintendo is still number one on the most popular gaming companies. They continue 
        to produce the same great content that they started with, and recently they came out with 
        the Nintendo classic console which allows people to play their original games again.
