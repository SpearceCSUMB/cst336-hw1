      <h2>Valve Corporation</h2>
      <p> Founded in Bellevue, Washington, Valve quickly took the PC gaming industry by 
        storm with one of their most popular games, Half-Life. With this game release 
        they grew a lot of popularity in the community though they were not quick at 
        producing games, though that did not stop them in their creations. With a few 
        ore than ten video games released, it seems off that they would still be number
        two on the top three gaming companies. </P>
    
      <P>In 2003 they released a client for all computers that would allow Valve to monitor 
        all the updates for their games; their creation was named Steam. This creation then
        turned into a gaming hub where PC players would be able to purchase games on their store, 
        keep them in one place, and whenever that game got an update, the client would automatically
        update the game (as long as the user was okay with it). </P>
    
      <p>The fact that this is one of the most popular gaming hubs on the computer,
        shows why Valve is a contender on this list, even though there are not a lot
        of games for them to show off. </p>
